I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University.
I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), scientific machine learning, and PDE-constrained optimization.

<b> Short Bio: </b> Before coming to Brown, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/casc">Center for Applied Scientific Computing</a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
<!-- where I am leading a three-year research project on PDE-constrained stochastic optimization methods for risk-averse engineering design. -->
Before that, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/">Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics</a>.
Before that, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Analysis at the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
Before that, I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~leszek/">Leszek Demkowicz</a>.

### Other notes:
- I still do finite element research! In fact, I'm an active [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) developer. Check out our (growing) list of examples codes and miniapps [here](https://mfem.org/examples/).
- This website has been tidied up a little bit. If you are interested in my old finite element work (2015-2020), short summaries can still be found [here](/research/).
